# budgie-superkey

## Supporting Superkey+<number> behavior to the budgie desktop.

The <number> is a reference to the nth pinned program in the taskbar.

Superkey+`<number>`
- Switch to the pinned program, if already open or start a new instance for the first time
- If an instance of the program has already the focus, switch to the next instance  
 
Superkey+Alt+`<number>`  
- Like Superkey+`<number>`, but reverse switching between instances  

Superkey+Shift+`<number>` 
- Start a new instance of the pinned program
